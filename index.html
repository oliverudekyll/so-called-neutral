                Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm very-very glad to
                start this series of lectures with you two. So I've introduced
                the assignment already and the project to the students, it's a
                question revolving around the term neutrality in the field of
                graphic design, which I believe is a term that can be put in
                perspective, questioned, or criticized.

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                I'm gonna read a biography of you and your practice and what I
                propose is that either we exchange on a question-answer mode or
                you present and then we ask questions.

                So, graphic designers Elizabeth Rafstedt and Johanna Ehde form
                Rietlanden Women's Office. Their practice is interested in
                current and historical issues connected to reproductive work and
                collaborative graphic design. The basis of their work is a
                printed publication series called MsHeresies that we have here
                that the students looked at already. Inquiry into collaborative
                graphic design practices and the ornament as a form of work
                critique and the ornament sits at the center of their practice,
                where they consider ornaments not simply as added decoration but
                as traces of the specific conditions under which a work was
                made. They look at the traces of reproductive work, such as
                lines of alteration and correction, flashing elements, improvise
                type, manifestations of urgency, become the ornaments which
                makes social relations legible. The search for ornaments,
                disruptive, diffuse and aesthetic qualities, and sketch the
                ornament as a point where aesthetics and politics intertwine.

                sharing space together that made us form a group after our
                studies.

                with the work and then we can speak a little bit more about why
                we have chosen to have a collective practice. But what you can

                that was supposed to be shown in Leipzig at the modern Museum of
                Art there at this very moment, in connection to the book, the
                Buchmesse, the book fair in Leipzig that they have there yearly.
                And it is a republishing of a Palestinian poet and her name is
                Hila Abunnada and she was murdered, she was killed during the
                bombings of her home in Gaza. The text comes from a publishing
                platform that you should really look up—GazaPassages.org—and
                it's a publishing project called Passages Through Genocide. And
                they asked for everyone to republish and distribute the work
                from these Palestinian poets. On this poster it reads from the
                8th of October last year. It reads, and this is Hila Abunnada,
                the writer, she wrote "Our news feeds of funeral homes, memorial
                services, obituary pages, we move from page to page as if
                walking through a square full of funerals packed side-by-side.
                God, the weight of these days." And this poster is not shown in
                Leipzig now because it is not neutral.

                But maybe we can also say that we both studied at the Gerrit
                Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. I'm sure you know about it. And
                when we finished our studies, together with some friends also
                who work together with Julie in Paris. We had this like shared
                ongoing discussion at the Academy about feminism and feminism's
                role in graphic design. And when we all finished our studies, we
                just became this perfect like entities of workers under the
                neoliberal society, which we disagreed with. And we sat there
                with our laptops and instead of still being friends we also
                became competitors with one another, which was a very lonely and
                sad kind of reality to be put in. So that's why we started
                Rietlanden Women's Office and Rietlanden comes from an area not
                far away from here where our first studio was. So that is a
                little bit the background of why we started working together.

                So here on the left you see a poster by the London based South
                Asian feminist collective Mukti. They were active between 1983
                and 1987. And Mukti, their publication, they had 6 languages in
                which they translated the publication into, and they are all
                represented on this poster. And then the ornament, that detail
                on the poster to the right, it's actually a fold of a poster
                that we made made for an Amsterdam initiative called Palace of
                Typographic Masonry and the ornaments come from the publication
                Triple Jeopardy that was made in New York by the Third World
                Women's Alliance between 1971 and 1975. And both of these
                publications have been part of our research in the publication

                So together, we make the publication series, MsHeresies, and our
                research often emerges from feminist publications of the
                so-called print activist movement of the 1960s to the late 80s,
                and concerns an overlap of collaborative graphic design and
                feminist graphic design history. By conducting research in both
                theory and practice, we experiment with and look at the
                typography, ornamentation and printmaking of collaboratively
                designed printed matter made within these movements. We're
                interested in furthering the field of graphic design by
                elaborating on graphic design's messy history, and its link to
                feminist print activist movements. And with this expression,
                messy history, we refer to the essay toward an expanded view of
                women in graphic design, Messy History versus Neat History by
                Martha Scotford. And it's from 1994.

                The feminist intersectional issue of what is and isn't
                represented in graphic design's history is important to our
                work, and we ask what graphic design has been and could
                potentially be by questioning dominant ways of thinking, seeing,
                making and organizing.

                And when working on with MsHeresies, we engage them with
                selected archival material and do a practical research, we call
                it. And that is research by designing. So our visual and
                theoretical interests include overlaps of subjects such as
                history, writing and representation, feminism and work critique
                and self-publishing and graphic design. And by seeking out and

                interviews with other makers and researchers within these

                Umm, but yeah, they write, and typical to society is the
                attitude that all labor done by women is crude. Many women will
                run minimum machines, sometimes in their lives, for their
                bosses, or even for political lovers. Hardly any women will be
                allowed near a more sophisticated press. We want to break that
                cycle by acquiring our own press but first, we wanted to break
                it by respecting people's labor within the limitation of the
                only machine allowed to us. We’re writing about these
                realizations to encourage other women to see the tools available
                to them as what they are. A mimeo is a small press, regardless
                of its degree of sophistication. So this is 1973 and, of course,
                this is when people took over the means of production to make
                this publication.

                the alternative approaches and activities that are often part of
                Women designers’ professional lives. We are very interested in
                this concept of messy history, and we’re taking this further to
                being especially interested in the designs made by those who
                perhaps didn't call themselves designers. yet produced beautiful
                objects of graphic design. This is often the case with these

                So print activism boomed between the 1960s and 90s in Europe and
                the US, and socially engaged collectives and organizations who
                wanted to increase awareness about their costs got together,
                made publications, and developed their own methods for spreading
                the words through printed matter. These methods in turn spurred
                writing and an array of manifestos and consciousness raising
                texts and their critical perspective on technologies, impact on
                social issues and visual communication, left visible traces in

                And the publications also became formative for the political
                movements at the time, and they visually embody an overlap
                between reader, writer, editor, designer and printer. We were
                very interested in that aspect of it. Also in terms of the
                ornaments. So the print activist movement critically questioned
                who had the means, access and knowledge to print and in turn,
                the power to distribute and produce knowledge. And this same
                question in relation to the definition of messy history is
                fundamental to our practice.

                published text by Lola Olufemi called, We're going to lose.
                Which is then paired with the visual essay from the Mukti

                practice situated between typography, print and image making and
                self publishing, we focus on ornamentation, where we consider

                graphic design made collaboratively and urgently. Evoking rage,
                curing maladies, expressing lust, or mocking those in power. We
                see the ornament as closely linked to graphic designs' role in
                the distributional knowledge and as a point where aesthetics and
                politics intertwine.

                The ornament in our idea of it isn't only an add-on value, but
                also a trace of reproductive work, or in a utopian sense, a
                trace of unalienated labor. The ornaments we collect in the
                archives are often traces of reproductive work, where their
                brokenness signifies their way of becoming ornaments, not made
                as only decorative, but often showing the pressing issues and
                conditions of the moment under which they were made.

                Being a graphic design collective, our motivation lies in
                finding ways of designing collaboratively and to critically
                engage with this topic of collaborative graphic design. And for
                us, this has to do with the lustful in making and in building a
                lifelong practice. It also has to do with an optimism about what
                graphic design can do and look like when considered a socially
                engaged practice. It then becomes necessary to build on and
                learn from a richer, more extensive graphic design history and
                to allow more space for underrepresented design practices,
                current as well as historic ones. This is not an altruistic
                mission, but a deep desire as feminist designers, it motivates
                us deeply. We are driven by a truly collaborative spirit and
                conviction that our practice of graphic design allows us to
                deeply engage with subjects. We tried to go into conversation
                with the material we give form to. And as we seek out the makers
                of feminist publications and ask them how they work together, we
                learn about the difference and similarities between different
                generations of makers. When it comes to working conditions,
                design methods and political struggles.

                undergone. And this act of captioning has been something we have
                developed throughout our practice, and we play with ways of
                collaboratively writing and typesetting these captions and often
                make them quite lengthy, sometimes humoristic, but always with
                an attempt for any reader to be able to trace back from where
                and in what context the specific details, detail, ornament, or
                part of the collection it originated.

                specifically, writing together. By using online softwares we
                have a practice of sketching sentences and editing each other's
                writing already. We're taking this practice further by trying to

                First, I wanted to say thank you so much for joining us. It’s
                great to have you as part of this program which is called
                ‘So-called Neutral’. It’s a typography and critical research
                assignment that we are doing with the students of the third
                bachelor of graphic design at KASK, and it questions the concept
                of neutrality or so-called ‘neutrality’ in typography. I thought
                it was more than relevant to have you as a speaker, as I guess
                you’re quite critical towards this term.

                So we’re welcoming Marie-Mam Sai Bellier (1994), a graphic and
                type designer, art director and editor. Her practice revolves
                around typography, its history, and its relationship with
                publications both within traditional and avant-garde. She
                invokes typography within visual arts and writing, through
                various research projects where History and Zeitgeist are
                naturally intertwined. She obtained a MA in Graphic Design with
                honors at the School of Fine Arts of Lyon in 2017; whereupon she
                won the Renaud Foundation Price the same year. Since, she
                co-directs the publishing house Diorama Publishing alongside
                Guillaume Sbalchiero and publishes the typographic magazine
                Revue Diorama, which introduced in 2020 the distribution of its
                fonts within Diorama Type Foundry. She considers the text as an
                image, as a subject, but also as a historical witness of its
                time. Her practice as a type designer and researcher is vividly
                present within her commissioned projects of graphic design. By
                conceiving visual identities for fashion, music, gaming, cinema,
                art, and more, her work witnesses a singular and tailor-made
                aesthetic, in which the text is always seen as an essence
                carrying the story and sculpting the silhouette of a word,
                empowering its meaning.

                Thank you so much. This is quite an old biography, because now
                I’m actually part of Bye Bye Binary, which is also type foundry.
                I will speak about it. Also I’m teaching at École des Arts des
                Décoratifs in Paris. It’s not decorative art, but it’s like
                applied art, and it’s quite like beaux-arts, but there is quite
                a difference. I like the approach of the school because it’s
                based on the notion of crossing media and crossing approaches
                and I love this idea. You will see it in my work, it’s very
                important to cross different kinds of languages to create a new
                language. I’m teaching graphic design (École des Arts des
                Décoratifs) for object design. I like the notion of having
                graphic design as an object and not just on paper. Thank you so
                much for the invitation. I’m very glad to present you this
                little document and I will try to think about the notion of
                neutrality because it’s very interesting actually.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                OK, so to neutralize identity… when I think about neutrality in
                graphic design, I have a lot of “bad souvenirs” because I think
                it’s very violent. When they wanted me to look for an image to
                speak about the Swiss style, I just typed in Helvetica on
                Google. I thought this was very funny because for me it’s
                completely the modernist idea of creating a style which can be
                universal or/and neutral. It’s very violent because it’s like
                the abstraction of identity. By using these kinds of fonts, it
                feels like everything should be on the same level.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                I was thinking about how I approached graphic design when I was
                a student at the School of Fine Arts and I found my first
                project and this was an invention of the sport “Ward”. “Ward”
                was a mix between the words “hard”, “words” and “war”, and this
                was the beginning of a group we formed with my friends; Roxanne
                Maillet, and many others. It was our first workshop of graphic
                design and at the time we mixed this workshop with another
                subject revolving the notion of genre. We just invented this
                word, but I don’t know if you know this text by Beatrice Warde,
                called “The Crystal Goblet”. It’s about the idea that typography
                needs to be transparent to elevate the meaning of a text., which
                was absolutely not what we wanted to do.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                It’s more about the celebration of identities. This part was
                very fun, because we were also working on the notion of identity
                in typography. It was our first work as a graphic designer. We
                had the idea of using graphic design to generate shapes for
                events, like this was a sport-event. We wanted to go for
                T-shirts or costumes, and we wanted to incorporate it in our
                style of presentation. We worked with typography and sometimes
                we tried to integrate a grid. It was very weird. We wanted to
                perform this grid with our body, we didn’t know what we wanted
                to do.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                The thing that I loved the most at school were my friends and we
                still are friends ‘til this day, which was a very important
                link. What you can see here are posters. This was the first
                graphic design that we did. We see Clara Pasteau and Auriane
                Preud’homme who are also graphic designers and artists. This was
                our first approach of typography; It was this kind of collage or
                kind of American graphic design. There was always this notion of
                legitimacy beyond the question of legibility because we wanted
                to do something very strong visually by using typography. But we
                were questioning if it was what we wanted to get out of it. We
                had the feeling that our teacher wanted us to learn how to do
                straight, neutral graphic design, like Beatrice Warde, But we
                wanted to do camp graphic design. It wasn’t common at this time.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is my first poster I made about typography and it helped me
                to find my way. my legitimacy in this question of legibility.
                It’s a poster about legibility. You have something very camp on
                the left side and something very straight on the other.
                Basically, what I love on the camp side and what the teachers
                wanted me to do on the straight side. It’s kind of the opposite.
                It’s a sentence by Fernand Baudin that I sent by post in this
                envelope. This was the beginning of my project called Diorama
                that I made with the Guillaume Sbalchiero and Clara Pasteau in
                the early days of Diorama, which is a type foundry now.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                It was about me wanted to do typography. I was like, I love it,
                but I don’t know if I have the rights to do it. I just send it
                to multiple sorts of people like designers, artists, …
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is us in the beginning with the first envelope of Diorama.
                That moment we loved these references, these type specimens from
                the 70s where you can find display fonts with a very nice layout
                and artist content. So, I was like, I love fantasy, I love these
                kinds of shapes and in the classification of typography, every
                font, every fantasy font or advertising font is displayed in one
                trash can, called fantasy. There is this noble history of
                typefaces and fantasy is almost like the trash where you can
                find lot of shapes. So for me, fantasy can be considered queer
                because in the definition of queer it says it is something
                beyond limits and without limits. Fantasy can be a space where
                there are a lot of different shapes.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is the first book where a girl called Nicolette Gray in the
                19th century made this kind of classification of the first
                display fonts from the 19th century and this is a wonderful book
                where you can find a lot of shapes. It’s very, very interesting.
                I made my dissertation about it when I was a student. It was
                about how to make something memorable by typography. I wanted to
                make a parallel to the book from the 19th century and also the
                display fonts from 70s to see how you can have a golden age in
                typography by using fantasy. I studied Nicolete Gray’s vision
                and these two figures called Herb Lubalin and Jurriaan Schrofer.
                Jurriaan Schrofer for the geometric, mathematical, structural
                approach. It was made before the computer, so it was very hard
                to draw this kind of composition, but it’s an approach which was
                very avant-garde. Not with the intension that something
                geometric should be something neutral. It’s something very
                optical, it’s very material and you can see everyone is included
                by a kind of resurrection of all shapes from the 19th century.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                It may look like something very new. It is a double approach,
                resurrection versus a new technology or a new approach of
                typography, and I think it’s always about a technological
                revolution, but it is also an approach on how you can use
                technology to create new shapes.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                During this moment when I was a student, I discovered the work
                of journalist, Jean Alessandrini who tried to make a new
                classification of fantasy fonts. He made the Codex 80 to try to
                give a name, to try to find a story for these shapes which were
                in this famous trash bin of fantasy classification. He made his
                own classification and it’s a very poetic and open project. I
                thought it was very nice and inspiring.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                So, this is Diorama #1 with all the contribution which we added.
                The thematic was legibility and visibility. It was very
                important for us to start with understanding our love for
                letters and this is a book about it. It is a type specimen with
                fonts that we drew for this theme, about this quote of Fernand
                Baudin. He said: “Whatever the taste that one has for
                legibility, clearness and transparency. It isn’t always
                sufficient, and not always for everyone. The eye isn’t only
                nourished by legibility but by all of the letter’s beauty. It
                could not be clearer. beauty”.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                We wanted to display the question of food, gluttony fonts
                because there was also lettering in chocolate. There were also
                some serif fonts, but more magazine fonts, more art nouveau.
                There were a lot of different styles and we enjoyed this project
                very much.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is my first font and an homage to the first advertising
                fonts in America. It is a wood type font with ornaments. I love
                ornaments and you will see that I prefer to design symbols
                instead of letters, but I will speak about that later.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                These are some screenshot of our type foundry and this was a big
                job because we made Diorama #1 when we were students, then we
                finished school and we were like: “OK, let’s go! What can we
                do?”. We didn’t have any plans. We didn’t have any money, and we
                just wanted to publish this book because we thought it was very
                cool and it was our dream to start a type foundry where these
                magazines would be like the birth of new fonts. It would be a
                collection of fonts and it would contain an editorial overview
                of the themes. We found a way to start a type foundry and we
                worked to get some money to start it up. Since a few months it
                has been published, so it’s very new. It was an adventure to be
                able to do it with our own money but… We did it! The digital
                side will be important for the issues of Diorama because it
                would be very interesting to do some events in our studio in
                Paris and to have a sort of shop where we can distribute other
                books from other people and also other fonts.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is a revival we made with Jean Alessandrini which was used
                for Klima magazine by Julie Héneault *laughs*. It’s a wonderful
                use of this font. The font was a kind of love story about
                science fiction fonts in the 70s made by Jean Alessandrini,
                which is a type designer. He is 80 years old now and he’s a
                friend and sometimes I go and see him in Strasbourg. He doesn’t
                have any internet, but he is actually still working at the idea
                of future in typography in the Latin alphabet.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                Here you see his research where he tried to find a new way to
                bring abstraction into the Latin alphabet and to make it evolve.
                He tried to erase some part of the letters that aren’t essential
                to make this “ultra-insulin”. It’s very interesting because it’s
                kind of a new vision on the letter, which will be a kind of
                ‘logotype alphabet’ where every word would be a logotype.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                I was like, “Oh my God. It looks like our research by Bye Bye
                Binary about the idea of bringing neutrality in the binary
                system of the French language. We try to find a typographic way
                to bring neutrality to the alphabet. This is very old. It’s from
                the first workshop we made with my friend Roxanne Maillet and it
                was about, how to find a way to make Jean Paul Gaultier. But
                again, this is also binary. It’s masculine—feminine, boys—girls.
                We wanted to go beyond the notion of binarity. This was not
                enough, we wanted more and so we tried to find solutions in
                typography with ligatures.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This was the first research and now Bye Bye Binary is a
                collective of type designers from Belgium and France which are
                working on finding a way to bring neutrality to French language
                with the medium of typography. It fits in with the times we live
                in now, but in a queer way. This, “La Typographie post-binaire”,
                is an amazing book that I presented regarding this post-binary
                idea. We were with Camille Circlude in Centre Pompidou in
                December to present this book. You can see the first research on
                the table. This is about neutrality, and you can see the kind of
                shapes that my friend made. You see some solutions to make it
                more neutral. It’s not about finding a way to a new norm for a
                new glyph or for a new system. Bringing neutrality in the French
                language in this way is open. It is very open and very free, so
                there’s space for everybody to bring a new idea, new solution.
                It is also about technology. Typography is technology because
                each new glyph has a unique code and to create new glyph, you
                have to find a space into this normative system. This is Jean
                Alessandrini’s new work, and you see that it’s looking quite the
                same within the idea of evolution of the Latin alphabet by the
                ligature. A few days ago, I was at the Atelier National de
                Recherche Typographique with him. It’s a research area in the
                School of Fine Arts in Nancy with type and graphic designers.
                There we did a workshop and a conference about the future of
                typography, and we made this little atelier where we tried in a
                few hours to make a new kind of alphabet. There is a 50-year
                difference between this old guy, Jean and me, but we have common
                ideas and links due to the same interest in the future of
                typography. It was very interesting.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                To come at geometry, what I love in geometry is the notion of
                ‘social geometry’. It is something that we approach in the
                second issue of Diorama. The second issue is about the future
                and about ‘The new geometric city’. And because I love gaming, I
                wanted to make a geometric alphabet, but as a scripture that you
                can build cities or to draw stuff with this alphabet only. I
                wanted to use the sentence of Vasarely, which is a quote from
                this issue:
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                “THE FUTURE IS EMERGING WITH THE NEW GEOMETRIC CITY, POLYCHROME
                AND SOLAR. PLASTIC ART WILL BE KINETIC, MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND
                COMMUNITY. ABSTRACT FOR SURE AND CLOSE TO SCIENCE.” Victor
                Vasarely, 1953
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                It’s from 54’, post second war and he thinks geometry will save
                the world. future is for sure a notion of sterilization of
                abstraction. It’s not about history, it’s about how everybody
                can feel something when looking at optical art.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                It’s hypotonic geometry, color and form. He wanted to bring a
                solution with this philosophy of geometry as a social geometry,
                because it’s for everybody. And brings also the notion of
                “grands ensemble”, The blocks, like in the ghetto, the idea of
                geometry where everybody can live. The philosophy at the time
                sounded beautiful, but we know today that it doesn’t work at
                all, and it only gets used by minority groups and it’s bad, it’s
                bad. But it was a nice idea that geometry would be for
                everybody, kind of like a universal language.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                What I love about the geometry of this time is the pop-approach
                and the colors, it was also used in fashion. Everybody used
                Vasarely works to make patterns, clothes, clocks, chairs. It was
                like a language, like a pattern, but yeah, it was also just
                philosophic.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                “The shadow of glyph a body”, is kind of my idea of what I want
                to do in my practice now. It’s about going beyond the Latin
                alphabet because it’s a result of colonial history. The Latin
                alphabet is spread all over the world, but it’s also violent for
                a lot of people to use. So sometimes I’m feel better in using
                just symbols which are not in Latin.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is my first artwork I made with the idea of creating a
                symbol which can be a sculpture, but it also can be a logo. This
                is the word ‘monochrome’ and it’s a sculpture, it’s painted wood
                in black. I think this is the first time I tried to use text
                beyond the page and it was the beginning of what I love to do
                nowadays.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                I also work a lot with fashion, and these are symbols that I
                made for bags or shoes. This is a picture of my favorite museum
                in France. I love this idea that ornaments in architecture can
                be very inspiring. This is also a work i did for fashion, about
                getting inspiration for patterns from historical things. This is
                a first project I made in this kind of way of
                incarnation/incantation of typography. This was an identity I
                made, a font identity for a festival for graphic design. I loved
                the stairs, so I used it like a grid to make this font. In the
                space of the letters, you can see a little phantom, a little
                ghost of characters, I love to use the space to design things or
                to materialize this kind of ghost of the space. And this is my
                logo, you could say. I love hearts and I love this kind of shape
                that you can find a lot in French, in a lot of buildings. Also,
                it’s an ideogram in Ghana, for which it has a signification. I
                love the idea that a symbol can exist in different parts of the
                world with different significations, but the heart is the most
                universal symbol that everybody knows and understands, and it’s
                about love and I love it.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                So, I started to make my own alphabet. This is a pic of a
                sculpture that I made during my residency in Lorainne. Where I’m
                a resident in the glass art research center. So, this is a
                series where I want to design sculptures with symbols like
                hearts for example, and this is one of the first sculptures in
                progress. I wanted to make a heart which looks like a flower
                called “l’amour en cage”, love in a cage in French. These will
                be my first sculptures. I love it because for me, it’s kind of
                like finding a new language but without words, without the latin
                alphabet, and to find a way to speak with a symbol which is
                material. With a a ideogram that I invented.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is another ideogram that I made for Bye Bye Binary, about
                non-binary, it’s a non-binary symbol. It was in this poster that
                we made in Centre Pompidou. The concept was a typographic
                battle. We made a series of posters about French academic words,
                the evolution of post-binary fonts and normativity. There’s lots
                of little workshops by Bye Bye Binary in different art centers.
                In these workshops I also love to go further in designing
                ideograms. This is a cryptic alphabet used for an artist called
                Erwan Sene. It’s again a way to twist the Latin alphabet. It’s
                kind trying to neutralize the Latin alphabet, but in my way.
                This is a monogram for Simon Lextrait, which is a brand. You can
                see it in this patch, the little patch. I also love fashion
                because of the material side it gives to text. This is a symbol
                for a gallery in Marseille called Sissi club.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is a poster where i used 3D to bring materiality to my
                symbols. For this gallery I will also do stained glass, like
                real stained glass. Because I wanted to change my order of
                graphic designer to glass designer. So, I will do some hearts in
                stained glass for their exhibition. Also, a new symbol without
                words, it’s an illustration, it’s kind of a weird pictogram for
                a performance company called Angels Front.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                I was also in a residency with Flora Bouteille and Sabine
                Teyssonneyre last week. It’s the Angel’s Front company. We’re
                doing a comic, all the things about this company are about
                language. For me, this comic needed to find materiality in the
                text, to have identities based on how characters are using
                language. For me this was impossible to use just one font, it
                wasn’t possible to just use Helvetica. I really wanted to find a
                new pleasure as a type designer to work on comics, to make it
                more visual, to make it more connected with the drawing.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is an alien alphabet for a photographer called Romain
                Lenancker. He wanted an identity for his exhibitions called “Une
                autre origine du monde”, or “Another origin of the world”. He
                didn’t want to use a science fiction typeface because it would
                be too caricatural, so we wanted to go beyond that. Because the
                client was very openminded, we made this alien alphabet. Then he
                just took photos for his identity with this font in use, you can
                see the catalog here. The idea was just to use the little
                ideogram to make footnotes of each photo, like each object. Each
                page was on a big map where you can see all the symbols, like an
                alien map as a summary. Finding a new way to use these non-Latin
                alphabet letters, and to make it work into an editorial project.
                So it was very nice.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                Here you can see an identity for Phylactère, which is a magazine
                of my friends, Roxanne Maillet and Auriane Preud’homme. It’s a
                revival of an old font from the 70’s called carnival. I’ve
                redrawn the alphabet, it took very long because there are a lot
                of curves in this font, but it is very beautiful. This kind of
                reborn letters in ribbons to speak about the “Phylactère” which
                is the name of the little bubble of text in comics or in
                medieval drawings.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                Here is a lettering alphabet I’ve drawn for the Centre d’Art
                Passage in Troyes. So I was in a residency to find a way to make
                an identity for this Centre d’Art with my friend Clara Pasteau,
                who also makes websites. And we were like okay, let’s find the
                “voice” of this place to bring a visual identity to represent
                this house. here You can see pictures of the house. It’s very
                beautiful and we’re like okay let’s make an identity, that
                speaks about this notion of passage, that speaks about time, the
                notion of questioning wat an art Centre is. It’s a place where
                artists come and go, so the notion of time is very important.
                Also, the concept of fine arts, like glass is very important in
                this region of France. So, we made this kind of alphabet to
                represent the Centre d’Art, and this is the website.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                This is the project we’re working on with the director of the
                art center to make a version of materiality, it’s not like a
                basic signaletic where you just write something on a plastic
                thing, it’s terrible. We wanted to bring value and a mix of
                people because we wanted to make artworks in glass, in metal, in
                colors and work with locals from the town. Also to work with new
                people who can bring stories.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                And to finish i want to show you this project. It was my first
                residency with children. The idea was to teach what graphic
                design is to children. It’s about the idea of characters,
                personage, type characters, to incarnate their own identity.
                Each child made this kind of mask and the persona is the
                reference, it’s also a game called persona. I love this game. We
                made the costume with my friend Simon from cyanotypes. I had a
                big house where my friends came, and we went to school every day
                with new people, someone in fashion, someone in gaming, someone
                in text. My students were so happy. We made this book about the
                notion of time, and I also participated with my assistant. The
                treasure is the time we have together, it’s not money. It was
                very nice to incarnate and show what creative jobs are or can be
                and to make work around identities. Each little guy thought
                about what his own culture looks like, as a child, as a person.
                There was always a little presentation about their end results,
                they were so happy. Afterwards we made this book about it, it
                was so nice.
              </p>

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                So as a conclusion, I think neutrality is a very interesting
                concept, because when we twist the notion of geometry, binarity
                and everything else, it can be very exciting to explore. What
                can a queer neutrality mean? It can just be the possibility of
                having a lot of different identities, where fantasy is
                neutrality.

                I think I love the way that you can use a system that is not
                systematic. I think there’s a system behind Diorama; each cover
                has the title Diorama on the book, but a different cover,
                format, way of binding, etc. but the title is never changing.
                And also there’s a system that in the book, you always have the
                definition of diorama as a specimen, a type specimen for the

                different font. This little booklet of specimen can be at the
                beginning, sometimes in the middle. But yeah, it’s very nice to
                imagine a system that’s not systematic and be playful with it.

                Oh, oh my god! That’s a very hard question, but I think maybe
                the font that I’m making now. I’m working with Bye Bye Binary on
                a new variable font, and the title will be ‘love and rage’. We
                will design two kinds of styles: love and rage, and I’m working
                on love. I try to do what I think love can be as a Latin
                alphabet. My first idea was to do something not systematic.
                Because typography is a system, it’s always like A-B-C-D and you
                can type it. But how do you make a font which is not systematic,
                based on freedom, based on emotion? I’m working with a kind of
                ribbon or something that can look like a drawing but also looks
                like an object. Trying to be everywhere but nowhere at the same
                time *laughs*.

                It will be very fun because you will have the two polar
                opposites ‘love and rage’, and something that will happen in the
                middle and we don’t know what that will be, but it will be very
                nice I think. The font is not yet accessible right now, but it
                will be open source.

                Actually we are now working on a queer font, but also an
                ultra-legible post-binary font. It will be a font for text. It’s
                very interesting to think about how after Helvetica, Swiss-fonts
                and everything, you can imagine a very legible font which will
                not be sans-serif or Swiss. They are also working on how to make
                each letter very recognizable for dyslexic people. A lot of
                people that don’t like post-binary fonts say it’s not completely
                inclusive, because people with difficulties to read cannot read
                this kind of shapes. So we are working on a font for dyslexic
                people which will be post-binary. It’s a very interesting
                approach, each letter needs to be different, to be recognizable,
                and this is not what we normally learn about sans-serif and
                modular fonts. It needs to be different to easily read it. So
                yes, it’s a nice concept and philosophy to find the perfect
                legible font.

                read things that are set up in sans-serif fonts, they have

                Actually, sometimes it’s a little draft and then I’ll translate
                it to my computer. But I need to think on a paper beforehand.
                I’m not a very good drawer. There are people like Jean
                Alessandrini who has never used a computer in their life, it was
                always cutting letters by hand. I think it’s very nice to try to
                cross a practice with another and finding this own way to make a
                typeface. And I also think that you don’t need to be a type
                designer to make a font.
              </p>
              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                Because in Bye Bye Binary, there are also people who are not
                type designers and they’re drawing letters, but that is what we
                want. It’s okay, you don’t need to make the perfect grid. It’s
                about what it’s looks like or what emotion we feel when looking
                at this text. And I think the Helvetica style is cheap, but
                identities are not, it’s so much more complex. It’s our job to
                translate identity by using graphic design and it’s very fun to
                try to make it legible. Because you see, this trend in the
                fashion industry of making every logo in a sans-serif, but after
                a while they will start to change it because no one has an own
                individual identity anymore.

                So they’ll start longing for a monogram or something different

                Now we’re in this phase where we’re trying to bring back history
                into letters when there was a time when as you said the
                “universal” was the neutral, the geometrical, the letters that

                Yeah, it’s very nice to see it. And for example, I was with Jean
                Alessandrini the last few days, and it’s crazy because he’s a
                fool, in this way, to think that he’s making like futuristic
                fonts. But for him, it’s not fantasy, it’s like he’s working for
                the world.

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                And I think it’s almost always a guy behind this way of
                thinking. Like the Swiss style, these universal fonts and
                wanting that everybody can read it, that it will work for
                everybody behind these pseudo-neutral fonts. It’s always men
                speaking about this vision, very masculine and very crazy in
                thinking that they’ll make it for everybody.

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                It’s not possible. It doesn’t exist, because using these fonts
                is also political. Choosing to do something a 100% neutral by
                using the Swiss style is political, it’s a choice. I don’t say
                that I don’t like Helvetica, I like sans-serif fonts, I use it
                and I’m also drawing sans-serif fonts. I always try to twist it
                with something, you can use a sans-serif font but with a color.
                The lettering I made for Simone Lextrait for example is a
                sans-serif but with a touch of art-nouveau. There’s always a way
                to not be neutral.

                Yes, me and my friend were considered the black sheeps. We
                weren’t considered good students because we weren’t into the
                Swiss style and nice grid. My teachers were only men. There were
                ten, and it was nine men. It was very sexist, because the
                atmosphere of the class was like “if you’re a girl you didn’t
                exist”. And my work was too close to art and not enough graphic
                design to be judged as design. For my first diploma, the jury
                said thank you so much for making it very singular, but we don’t
                know if we if we can give you a diploma because it’s not graphic
                design, it’s art, so we can’t judge it. So there was a certain
                definition about graphic design. That guy was Spassky Fisher,
                his studio is about neutralizing identities.

                I was like okay, let’s find a way to make my art legible, so I
                made typography to please everybody. And now I make structures
                because I think that I prefer it. But it was a long way. My
                friend Roxanne Maillet was the same. It was too messy to be
                “good” graphic design, because graphic design was always about
                using a grid. So it also wasn’t a good use of the tools of the
                software. We weren’t good at micro-typography or typesetting.
                But we continued to do the same until today and we are happy. We
                learned how to be ourselves. The teachers weren’t happy at that
                time, but we stayed the same and it’s very nice to see the
                results now.

                And now I’m also teaching graphic design. But what I like is to

                software or explaining them how to do a good layout or how to
                use InDesign. I don’t teach InDesign, I teach to love graphic

                In my class you start by writing a letter to someone, but from
                another planet. You imagine a world that could be in the future,
                in the past or present, maybe in fantasy, game or film. You
                write a letter to someone to explain where you are and that you
                found some interesting stuff in this special world. It’s an
                object containing text. During the three first classes they just
                have to write. They must imagine where they are, in what style
                this world would presents itself, the political surroundings,
                maybe even any resistance? It’s a very creative process. In the
                next step they start to design the object that they found. They
                have to be very precise with the fonts, etc. that they choose
                because it has to represent this world. Which color? Which
                material? Which objects?

                They can choose to use Photoshop or InDesign or any other way of
                working, it’s very free. It makes the teaching very individual.
                I want them to feel confident with the idea of translation by
                graphic design. I want them to feel free and love it in how they
                use it. Instead of designing in a way which is very boring. If I
                would choose to give a class purely focused on using the program
                InDesign, they would be bored and probably hate me.

                My classes are usually very funny, and I have a nice
                relationship with my students. They know that graphic design is
                a free space of fun, identities, etc. Now they’re all very close
                and even want to have an exhibition together. They sent me a
                message thanking me and saying how they enjoyed their time and
                now we want to do a big dinner where everybody makes an object.
                Like someone can make a chandelier, someone else can make a
                table, … I’m happy that this notion of identity can reflect in
                the shape of an event, an objects or other types of work.

                Thank you for being here! You're here with us today as two
                members of the Velvetyne Type Foundry, a collective that's
                interested in typography and especially free to use typography
                and open source. I wanted to invite you because a lot of our
                students use your tools and your fonts. The topic of the
                assignment is about questioning the term neutrality which is
                often used in typography. The title of the assignment is
                “so-called neutral” and it's a series of lectures online. You
                are about to conclude the cycle of lectures; we welcomed
                Rietlanden Women's Office for the first lecture and the second
                one was Marie Mam Sai Bellier. You will be giving us the last
                presentation. Quentin Juhel is a graphic designer, a teacher and
                a developer. He is fascinated by the close relationship between
                technique and form and uses free or open source tools and
                programming to design hybrid graphic forms between paper and
                digital. He is interested in looking at new ways to create,
                whether for publishing, web design or communication projects. He
                spent some time in the ENSAD Research Laboratory developing his
                research about open-source tools and design. Today, he regularly
                organizes collaborative explorations in informal research
                groups, workshops and discussions such as PrePostPrint or
                Relearn and teaching is an essential part of his work. He's also
                part of the publishing project, Atelier TÉMÉRAIRE and since 2021
                he has been part of the team of Velvetyne Type Foundry. On the
                right you have Raphaël Bastide. Who creates convivial
                instruments, pedagogic strategies, performances, sometimes
                objects and installations. He develops a particular interest in
                graphic, algorithmic and sound sequences through the creation of
                tools, programs, languages. He is a free software culture
                enthusiast and extends those values through experimental
                practices developed in collectives, such as valuating type
                something and PrePostPrint, experimental publishing. He lives
                and works in …Montreuil and teaches at Beaux-Arts de Paris and
                École des Arts Décoratifs de Paris. Tell us if there is more to
                add and what you think of so called neutrality.

                Thank you for the introduction and the invitation as well. We
                are happy to be able to talk and discuss with you. More or less
                we will be going through the introduction of the collective
                “Velvetyne”, then we will talk a little bit about what it is
                that we want to release, and how do we do that. We will show you
                what our strategies are when we want to release something. (What
                are the criteria? Etc.) Then we will go through a couple of
                examples of fonts that are already on our font list and the
                website and how they kind of relate to the subject of
                neutrality, and maybe more specifically about readability. At
                the end we will try to speak about a workshop we didn't attend
                to *laughs* made by Océane Juvin and Jérémy, members that could
                not be here today.

                Velvetyne is an association and collective dedicated to
                researching and disseminating typography and typeface creation,
                our effort manifests through collective creation, workshop,
                public engagements and the promotion of open, playful tools that
                embrace an inhibited approach to typography. Our editorial
                practice revolves around building a politically and artistically
                supported typographic universe, collaborating with diverse and
                engaged authors. Together, we give life to fonts and graphical
                objects under open license, allowing user modification and
                redistribution. Additionally, we explore unconventional paths,
                fostering transparency and inclusivity to make typeface creation
                more open and dynamic. We call ourselves Velvetyne Type since a
                few months because we tried to open a more global orientation.

              <p class="interview__segment__column__p">
                We are used to releasing fonts only and we try to release some
                other non-font objects too. These can be articles, text, music,
                licenses, tools... We didn't want to get trapped into the font
                format for many reasons, so right now it's still an ongoing
                experimental project, but we really want to work on it more.
                This is the about page and we can see the four rules that show
                what you can do with this liberal software or open-source
                software, it is kind of the same. You can use it, modify it,
                redistribute it, and redistribute the modification of it. So as
                a font is half software, let's say, it applies to font format as
                well. So all the fonts that you can find on our website are free
                and have open source licenses, meaning you can use it for free,
                modify it for free and redistribute it for free. The collective
                exists for almost 12 years now, but we didn't invent the
                open-source license, that exists for almost 30 years now. The
                license that we use for the fonts is problematic. We don't like
                it, but we don't have the choice to change it (yet). It's
                problematic because it allows too much and especially it allows
                companies we don’t align with to use, share and distribute our
                fonts. And also the root of this license is an evangelistic
                association. So it's not really something we want to support,
                because it's not inclusive enough for us. Here you can see our
                catalog and there is not so much left actually. We released a
                lot more fonts, but recently we made a new website and did a
                “cleaning” of our list.

                Yeah, we had a discussion about how big the catalog was and how
                it was not representing Velvetyne anymore, the political
                orientation or vision we have and we voted within the collective
                to see who wanted some fonts to retire and which fonts it would
                be. Some of them we took away because they were too cliché or
                too old, in the way that they didn’t represent our aesthetics
                anymore. I think we removed about 39 fonts or maybe a little bit
                more. We also did not want it to be a big collection of free
                fonts like Google Fonts or Dafont, open font library.

                We think the position of having an editorial statement means
                also being able to remove things from the façade of Velvetyne,
                which for us is mainly the website, it was a bit hard and it was
                a bit tricky to tell our invited designers that their font, that
                stayed on the front page for over 10 years got removed. But I
                think that it’s for the best and we are happy to have a small
                but cool list of fonts representing the collective as it is. And
                when I think about neutrality, it's a really non-neutral move to
                do this. It was not that fluid and easy for us. It was really
                about discussions, voting, and argumenting, but we managed and I
                think everybody's happy with the results. Some of us did this
                workshop last August to work and discuss new licenses because of
                the issues we have with the current free software license we use
                on the website. And also to discuss the collective itself. It's
                kind of hard to discuss in real life because members are spread
                through Europe. Germany, Brussels, Paris, The Alps,… It helps a
                lot to gather and to discuss in real time, to spend time
                together, eating, preparing food.

                Mariel works together with Bye Bye Binary which is currently
                working on this idea of creating a new glyph to include all
                people; male, female and also nonbinary people. And there is a
                lot of fonts in the Velvetyne library that are inclusive. It’s a
                fight with the conservative people who are saying that it’s not
                readable for people. I think it's an interesting question about
                legibility and readability. There is no scientific proof that
                says it is legible for people to read these kinds of glyphs, but
                some people in the Académie Française find it “very difficult to
                read.”

                What you can see here in this demo is a font we made for the
                website which is the Velvetyne font called Velveline. It is not
                released yet, but it will be, so stay connected *laughs*. We can
                maybe make a subtle bridge here to what and how we release
                within Velvetyne? We made some rules for ourselves to be able to
                pick what we are going to release and what not. Because usually
                what happens is that people come to us through mail, for
                instance, and say: “Hey, I have this project and I would like to
                collaborate with you and to have it released as a Velvetyne
                font.” We receive mails like that on a regular basis, maybe one
                or two, maybe three or five a month, sometimes one a week. But
                it's kind of rare that we would say yes, because it depends on
                our current state of releases. It has to be something that
                doesn't exist yet, like for instance we have a lot of
                submissions with pixel fonts, but we already have a couple of
                those fonts and we don't feel like we want to focus on that
                anymore.

                We can’t say no just because it doesn't fit with the current
                mood of the collection. There are also three other aspects we
                want to focus on. Firstly the font should have a strong concept,
                meaning not just a visual. It can be unstable visually or it can
                not fit into what is seen as qualitative in the industry. We
                don't really care about that, because then it can lead to a
                collaboration between us as a collective and the person who is
                asking. We have lots of knowledge in the collective, especially
                font engineering, so we are able to help in the development of a
                project. Of course, the project should have been developed in
                the first place, but we can help to finish it and to focus on
                things we think are interesting.

                Second; a challenge for the user. We don't want to have soft
                typography and we would like it to be a bit challenging. It can
                be conceptually formal, it can be fun as well, it can be
                humorous. It can also be a pretext to talk about something else,
                like, for instance, political things, cultural niche, or
                subcultures. JGS Font is a good way to illustrate it. It’s a
                font made for ASCII art, everything is connected, centered and
                made to make drawings. So you can see that the glyphs connect
                pretty well. GJS was made by Adel Faure and released two years
                ago.

                This font is also a tribute to the artist Joan G. Stark. As you
                can see, I am scrolling through an article that Adel wrote. It
                briefly goes through the history of ASCII art and I think that's
                the way we want to release fonts. Here you can see that the
                design itself is made to be perfectly compatible with the
                drawing grid.

                So that was the 2nd rule and the third is a good story, and I
                think it's connected to what I said. GJS, has a story, but the
                font itself can also tell a good story, for example,
                “resistance” is a font which was made during a workshop
                organized by Velvetyne together with the students of the école
                National des Arts Décoratifs. The “I” is really weird because
                due to the very specific constraints of the collaborative work.
                We used a tool, that was really incomplete at the time, but we
                did that on purpose, called “glypher”. It's a free online
                software tool that still exist and now it's much more complete.
                It was really fun to collaborate on the font together, but
                obviously the collaboration aspect had huge impact on the final.
                We loved it so much, we were pretty proud of the final results.

                It was really, really fun and also really political, because at
                the time, in 2016, it was a huge year for political fights like
                Nuit Debout: the occupation of République Place in Paris. I
                think it’s closely related to the idea of Velvetyne promoting or
                questioning fonts and collective works for supporting or for
                archiving these political fights.

                To finish the last rule, the good story, as you may know making
                a font is very hard and takes a long time. So making a font with
                10 or 20 hands, it's definitely more difficult than designing
                and making the decisions on your own, especially if you want to
                finish in five days. This is kind of a statement as well and
                that's the good-story-aspect of it.

                be very institutional like a Parisian mayor or political groups,
                students, but also companies that sell shoes or perfumes for
                example. Velvetyne is also used by a famous artist, like Beyoncé

                So this next font is ‘Kaeru Kaeru’, which was made by Isabel
                Motz during a workshop with Jérémy Landes in HfG Karlsruhe. The
                workshop was led by Jérémy, who is a member of Velvetyne since
                the beginning of the collective. Jérémy decided to make the
                student work with inspiring illustrations and make a font face
                out of it. I think the origin of Kaeru Kaeru was inspired by a
                frog named Kaeru Kaeru. So this is another example of a workshop
                that leads to a point that we decide to release the font. With
                the help of the designer of course. It's kind of legible to me,
                but it flirts with the non-legible, especially in a bigger size.

                Maybe we can talk a bit about Fungal. When the user makes a
                modification, which is not part of the main idea of the project,
                let's say a software or a font, it's called a fork. So it's like
                a derivation from the main branch and we love forks at Velvetyne
                because it's a way to embody the free software.

                A fork, in my opinion, is also very historical. I think behind
                the idea of forking fonts it's not only fun, but also very
                deeply rooted in the history of type creation. You can see a
                fork of the Linux font distribution for example. We are really
                interested in these new typefaces and we want to promote it in
                the new generation of Velvetyne.

                So back to fungal. Fungal is a fork of ‘DejaVu sans’. DejaVu
                sans looks like that one, more or less. It’s a Linux system font
                which is kind of boring, but it's really functional. It was
                supposed to be used on LibreOffice at the time it was
                Openoffice, I think, but also for interfaces like the Windows
                system. It's a design that is optimized for the large audience
                and efficiency in terms of legibility. We decided to take font
                as a base, ‘we’ as in myself and Jeremy. I asked Jeremy to help
                me with the technical details and we went through a really quick
                process of collaboration to achieve this variable font design.
                So this is Fungals’ variability; there is 2 axis, the thickness
                and the growth the legible aspect of it enters when the font is
                fully covered by this organic biomorphic ornament, which was a
                wish from the beginning. I wanted to make a really ornamental
                font with something a bit brutalists. Because the origin of this
                project was a Wikipedia-article-project. It's a web art project
                that led to a zine as well. The font was made especially for
                this project and we knew from the beginning, that it would be
                released on Velvetyne later. So here you can see the spread of
                the font, but also the figures. The longer you stay on this
                website, the more you can see that figures, fonts and also the
                Wikipedia logo are spreading. In the end, the article is not
                legible anymore. When I scroll to the bottom of this project,
                you can see that there is small description and a pretext about
                Wikipedia, it was a tribute So sometimes we collaborate as core
                members, but it's we try to leave the space for let's say
                non-core members, people who want to collaborate with us.

                We can also talk about ouvrières, which is a good example of
                someone who proposed a fonts with a simple idea at the
                beginning. It’s an ant-inspired typeface. Laure Azizi came to us
                with this idea of a variable font, where you can see a very
                organized ants create a glyph and you can play with the
                variables to make it messier. We proposed her to work on it for
                a bit longer, to come closer to the actual nature of ants, which
                include different sizes, a queen, fighters, workers, etc. When I
                comes to transporting food, searching food or building
                constructions, the colonies organize themselves and get every
                ant to work in line. It’s almost an illustration of their way of
                working, it’s funny. It was as we explained at the beginning, a
                proposal of a font which isn’t fully stable. Laure came with
                this idea almost a year ago and we began to help her technically
                to make this font and the idea usable. Especially for variable
                fonts it can be tricky to make it usable for every website. And
                this is a good representation of the idea of a mixing legible
                and illegible fonts. Before there were in the history of
                typefaces different weights and different styles like Italics,
                bolds, lights,.. and now with the concept of variable front you
                can really change the way you draw and use these fonts. You’re
                able to make hybrid and free typeface, which is interesting.
                This font is a perfect example of it, yes.

                At Velvetyne we received some questions about if the typefaces
                are accessible in underrepresented scripts like Cyrillic. Here
                you can see a font drawn by Walid Bouchouchi, who is a Algerian,
                and in Algeria you use the script called Tifinagh. Tifinagh is a
                combination between the glyphs which are accessible on your
                computer, and French and Arabic words. There is no existing
                typeface which gives the possibility to use Tifinagh. But since
                few years there are type designers trying to write or draw fonts
                that can use this script language. It's now beginning to be
                indexed in the Unicode and in Velvetyne we really want to make
                our fonts accessible and legible in different languages. We've
                got the Tifinagh, Cyrillic and, I don't know if it's still
                published already, but there is a Vietnamese typedesigner
                working on the Vietnamese glyph support. I think it's also a
                good way to talk about legibility or being a neutral or
                non-neutral type foundry. It’s not about selling our fonts or
                distributing and becoming famous, but to have fonts accessible
                to minorities, we want to give them a place in Velvetyne. Here
                you can see the Tifinagh grotesk version. Grotesk is a typeface
                created by Frank Adebiaye, the founder of Velvetyne. It can be
                used by Algerian people.

                It’s important to say that we also update our font catalogue.
                For instance, this project has been updated at least two times.
                So there is this small, network for each font that has been
                updated showing the previous versions and this one is linear,
                but it’s often not. At the beginning of the project no lower
                case, only an upper case. And in the next version of it includes
                the glyphs we talked about. For instance, Ariel Martin Perez,
                who is a member of Velvetyne, made a lot of updates like that
                for his own fonts, but also for font designs from other people.
                And that's really something super nice I think to have a font
                that is able to evolve and having it's identity getting changed
                through time. Accepting multiple languages and writing systems.
                We can maybe talk quickly about this last project. ‘unstable
                signs’ was a workshop led by Jérémy ‘and Ocean, so that's not us
                *laughs*. It was in 2020 at the Basel Art School. It talks about
                the stabilization of the current language we use in Latin
                countries and how to go back to unstable signs. That was the
                goal for this workshop. “unstable signs as radical tools” by
                Anja Kaiser and Garrett Nelson was the base-resource. It was
                during the pandemic, so it was online and they asked the
                students to come with objects that brought them peace. So, as
                you can see there are multiple different objects or matters.
                From that object they started designing fonts. They went through
                wild graphic decisions, and it was apparently super rich. It was
                raising the question of the problematics of the sign and
                legibility, recognizability. They explored the gray zone between
                abstraction and representation, novelty and habits,
                meaningfulness and meaninglessness. A last word about
                communication, We are present on Mastodon, which is a free,
                decentralized social network. We are quite active there and
                there is a whole community following us already, so do not
                hesitate to create an account because it's a nontoxic place to
                communicate. For people who don't want to use Mastodon, we are
                not anymore on Instagram.

                I have tons of questions and remarks. In this last workshop that
                you showed, there's this idea of coming back to how fonts design
                was less canonic or was less made of rules, and the shapes
                themselves become more organic and I wanted you to come back a
                bit on the question of the unicode table, which I believe is
                also something that is restraining in a way. Could you maybe
                explain to the students what this Unicode table exactly is and
                how it's kind of framing the making and distributing of fonts.

                To use a font, the computer has the know where the font is
                registered in the code and to do this we use what we call a
                Unicode table. It’s an organization which exists of glyphs
                organized into a big table. Each glyph has it’s code,
                referencing all the scripting languages. As you know, they are
                critical about who decides where these fonts are located in this
                table. I know there are a lot of complaints from the people from
                Africa and Asia saying that it’s missing some glyphs for their
                languages. It’s a huge discussion, but it's also questioning the
                standardization of the language. It's really tricky.

                Isn't it kind of paradoxical? Wanting everyone to be able to
                spread fonts language and talk, but still within a certain set
                of rules, with the question of who made those rules and who were
                they made for in the 1st place? Do you have a specific rule for
                the tools which are used to make your fonts?

                No, we don't and we don't want to. Since the beginning we have
                been really interested in free software tools like FontForge for
                example, which was one of the only professional graded good
                character design tool. Now it's not anymore really. I personally
                use that one to make fonts because I choose to work only with
                free software, but I think it's really important to leave the
                door of the tools open to have different, graphic signatures for
                every project. People come with their own tools and as long as
                the font itself is free I think it's nice to have a diversity of
                tools, even if they are not free software. In a pedagogic
                context it is a really bad thing to constraint the tools because
                the 3-4-5 years after school is an intense, technical and
                conceptual research time. We really want to be open to young
                designers, people who are still in school and also people who
                are not part of the design academic system. We can totally
                accept fonts made by amateurs and we don't want the tool choice
                to be a constraint. In the context of workshops, we like to
                invent our own tools or to take tools that are really weird but
                suited for the workshop thematics.

                Yes, we've got an ongoing discussion; since the last two or
                three months there is the question of wether paying for the
                Glyphs program for two members of Velvetyne. I know there is no
                correct answer or solution for this question because some of us
                are not OK with paying for some proprietary software.

                There is something we didn't say when we talked about the
                criteria for new fonts and that's quite important in my opinion,
                we try to release fonts that are not commercially compatible. We
                had some bangers on Velvetyne and we don't want to do that
                anymore because if it works too well and it's used by big
                advertising companies, it's not a good sign for us. We want to
                make stuff that can't exist in a commercial context, because we
                want to leave the space for other projects. It’s a bit the same
                for tools, I think our foundry crystallized lots of different
                tools used for fontmaking. It can be algorithmic, it can be a
                self made tool, it can be glyphs, fontlab or fontforge, it can
                be weird online tools,… We have a page on the website with
                tools.

                Recently we made this page, it’s an article written by Quentin
                called ‘Velvetyne Libre Friends’. Velvetyne is used a lot in
                context, especially art school context and we wanted to take the
                opportunity of the visibility that we have, to showcase other
                interesting foundries or font collections. So on Velvetyne Libre
                Friend, you can have access to a list with really cool other
                projects like the bye bye binary foundry, Badass Libre Fonts by
                Womxn,…

                I wanted to thank you to show us that fonts are also vessels. Of
                course, there are vessels for texts, but they're also vessels
                and pretexts for conversations or events that kind of support
                communities and they are also bags carrying a lot of other
                things with them. I think it's really important that foundries
                like yours continue the work of keeping this side of the fonts
                making, fonts using and font distributing, because there is this
                tendency and a pressure of making things and tools that should
                be efficient, and I think sometimes no low-efficiency is also a
                fruitful and interesting and maybe slower or maybe it works less
                well, but it can be poetic and beautiful. So thank you so much
                for the time, energy and content.
